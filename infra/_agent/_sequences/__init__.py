"""
Sequence modules for different inference patterns.

This module provides five main sequence types:
- simple: Basic inference sequence (IWI-IR-OR-OWI)
- grouping: Grouping-based inference sequence (IWI-IR-GR-OR-OWI)  
- quantifying: Quantification-based inference sequence (IWI-IR-GR-QR-OR-OWI)
- imperative: Complex imperative inference sequence (IWI-IR-MFP-MVP-TVA-TIP-MIA-OR-OWI)
- assigning: Assignment-based inference sequence (IWI-IR-AR-OR-OWI)
- judgement_typed: Typed-cortex credential sequence (IR-TVK-OR)
