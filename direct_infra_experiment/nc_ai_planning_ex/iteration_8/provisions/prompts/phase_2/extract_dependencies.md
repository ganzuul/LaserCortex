# Extract Dependencies (What Needs What)

## Task

Identify all **dependency relationships** between concepts and operations. This defines data flow and execution order.

## Inputs

- `input_1` — The refined instruction
- `input_2` — Extracted concepts
- `input_3` — Extracted operations

---

## The Core Question

For every concept and operation, ask:

> **"What do I need to produce this?"**

This recursion builds the dependency graph:
1. What's the final output?
2. What operation produces it?
3. What does that operation need?
4. Repeat for each input...

## Dependency Types

| Type | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **produces** | Operation creates concept | "extract sentiment" → produces → "sentiment score" |
| **needs** | Operation requires concept | "extract sentiment" ← needs ← "customer review" |
| **sequence** | One after another | "generate report" ← after ← "iteration completes" |
| **aggregates** | Collection built from items | "positive reviews" ← collects ← "review" (per iteration) |
| **conditions** | Boolean controls execution | "add to list" ← gated by ← "is positive" |

---

## Indicator Phrases

**Temporal order**:
- "after X", "then", "once X is complete" → sequence dependency
- "first X, then Y" → X before Y

**Data flow**:
- "using X", "from X", "based on X" → X is input
- "produces Y", "results in Y" → Y is output

**Aggregation**:
- "collect all", "add to", "gather" → items → collection

## Example

**Instruction**: "For each review, extract sentiment. If positive, add to positive reviews. Generate report from positive reviews."

**Concepts**: customer reviews, customer review, sentiment score, is positive, positive reviews, summary report

**Operations**: iterate, extract sentiment, check if positive, add to list, generate report

```json
{
  "thinking": "Report needs positive reviews. Positive reviews built by conditional append. Append needs review and condition. Condition needs sentiment. Sentiment needs review. Review comes from iteration over reviews.",
  "dependencies": [
    {"from": "generate report", "to": "summary report", "type": "produces", "description": "Report operation produces output"},
    {"from": "positive reviews", "to": "generate report", "type": "needs", "description": "Report needs collected reviews"},
    {"from": "add to list", "to": "positive reviews", "type": "aggregates", "description": "Collection built by appends"},
    {"from": "is positive", "to": "add to list", "type": "conditions", "description": "Append only if positive"},
    {"from": "check if positive", "to": "is positive", "type": "produces", "description": "Check produces condition"},
    {"from": "sentiment score", "to": "check if positive", "type": "needs", "description": "Check needs score"},
    {"from": "extract sentiment", "to": "sentiment score", "type": "produces", "description": "Extraction produces score"},
    {"from": "customer review", "to": "extract sentiment", "type": "needs", "description": "Extract from current review"},
    {"from": "iterate", "to": "customer review", "type": "produces", "description": "Iteration provides current item"},
    {"from": "customer reviews", "to": "iterate", "type": "needs", "description": "Iterate over collection"}
  ],
  "data_flow": [
    {"operation": "iterate", "inputs": ["customer reviews"], "output": "customer review"},
    {"operation": "extract sentiment", "inputs": ["customer review"], "output": "sentiment score"},
    {"operation": "check if positive", "inputs": ["sentiment score"], "output": "is positive"},
    {"operation": "add to list", "inputs": ["customer review", "is positive"], "output": "positive reviews"},
    {"operation": "generate report", "inputs": ["positive reviews"], "output": "summary report"}
  ],
  "summary": {
    "root_output": "summary report",
    "ground_inputs": ["customer reviews"],
    "execution_order": ["iterate", "extract sentiment", "check if positive", "add to list", "generate report"]
  }
}
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **Wrong direction**: Dependencies flow from inputs TO outputs, not reverse
2. **Missing conditions**: Conditional operations depend on their condition
3. **Missing aggregation**: Collections depend on their item source
