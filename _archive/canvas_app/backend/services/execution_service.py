"""
Execution control service with Orchestrator integration for Phase 2.

This module provides the public API for execution control. The implementation
is organized into sub-modules in the `execution/` directory:

- execution/controller.py: Core ExecutionController class
- execution/log_handler.py: Orchestrator log capture and parsing
- execution/paradigm_tool.py: Custom paradigm loading
- execution/tool_injection.py: Tool monitoring and injection
- execution/checkpoint_service.py: Checkpoint management
- execution/value_service.py: Value override and dependency tracking
- execution/worker_registry.py: Normalized worker management (NEW)

This file provides backward-compatible exports and the ExecutionControllerRegistry.
The registry now uses WorkerRegistry internally for unified worker management.
