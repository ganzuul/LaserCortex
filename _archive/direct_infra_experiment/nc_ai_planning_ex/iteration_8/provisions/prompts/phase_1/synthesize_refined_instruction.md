# Synthesize Refined Instruction

## Task

Combine the answers to the 7 refinement questions into a **single, clear, comprehensive instruction** that is suitable for NormCode derivation.

## Input

You will receive:
- `input_1` — Array of question-answer pairs from refinement (refinement answers)

---

## Goal

Transform vague intent into a **derivable instruction**—one that directly maps to the five core NormCode patterns:

| Pattern | What It Represents |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Linear Chain** | Transform A into B |
| **Multiple Inputs** | Combine A and B to produce C |
| **Iteration** | For each X, produce Y |
| **Conditional** | Do A if condition is true |
| **Grouping** | Bundle A, B, C together |

The synthesized instruction should make it obvious which patterns apply.

## Rules of Thumb for Paraphrasing

Apply these rules to convert inferred answers into concrete language:

### Rule 1: Make implicit loops explicit

| Vague | Refined |
|-------|---------|
| "Process the documents" | "For each document in the collection, extract summary" |
| "Handle user requests" | "For each request, until user disconnects, process and respond" |
| "Iterate until done" | "For each item, append to results if condition X holds" |

**Key phrase**: "For each X in Y, do Z"

---

### Rule 2: Name the data explicitly

| Vague | Refined |
|-------|---------|
| "Analyze it" | "Analyze the price data to produce quantitative signals" |
| "Get the result" | "Compute the sentiment score from the review text" |
| "Process the input" | "Parse the user message into a structured command" |

**Key pattern**: Use specific nouns with clear types

---

### Rule 3: Make conditions concrete

| Vague | Refined |
|-------|---------|
| "If appropriate" | "If sentiment score > 0.7" |
| "When ready" | "After all signals are computed" |
| "Unless there's a problem" | "If validation fails, use fallback value" |

**Key pattern**: Conditions should have clear true/false criteria

---

### Rule 4: Identify what triggers iteration

| Vague | Refined |
|-------|---------|
| "Keep going" | "Append new item to collection; loop continues while collection grows" |
| "Listen for messages" | "Block waiting for user input; each input triggers one iteration" |
| "Process continuously" | "For each item in stream, as items arrive" |

**Key pattern**: Self-seeding loops terminate via conditional append

---

### Rule 5: Decompose compound operations

| Vague | Refined |
|-------|---------|
| "Understand the user" | "1. Parse message, 2. Extract intent, 3. Identify entities" |
| "Make a decision" | "1. Evaluate conditions, 2. Generate applicable recommendations, 3. Synthesize final decision" |
| "Clean the data" | "1. Remove nulls, 2. Normalize values, 3. Deduplicate" |

**Key pattern**: Break down verbs into ordered steps

---

### Rule 6: Distinguish LLM vs deterministic operations

| Needs LLM | Needs Script/Computation |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| "Determine sentiment" | "Compute sum of digits" |
| "Generate response" | "Parse JSON" |
| "Judge if user wants to quit" | "Check if number equals zero" |
| "Extract themes from text" | "Divide by 10" |

**Key insight**: LLM for ambiguous reasoning; scripts for deterministic computation

## Requirements for the Synthesized Instruction

The synthesized instruction MUST:

1. **Be self-contained**: All necessary information in one document
2. **Be unambiguous**: No vague terms like "process" or "handle"
3. **Specify all I/O**: Clear inputs and outputs with formats
4. **Detail all steps**: Concrete actions, not abstract goals
5. **Clarify iterations**: Explicit "for each X in Y" patterns
6. **Clarify conditions**: Explicit "if X then Y else Z" patterns
7. **Show dependencies**: What needs what to complete

---

## Synthesis Process

1. **Start with the goal** (from Question 1: Final output)
   - What is produced at the end?
   - What format is it in?

2. **Identify the inputs** (from Question 2: Inputs)
   - What data exists at the start?
   - These become "ground concepts"

3. **Map the transformation** (from Question 3: How)
   - What steps convert inputs to outputs?
   - Order them by dependency

4. **Add iteration structure** (from Question 4: Iterations)
   - Wrap appropriate steps in "for each" patterns
   - Identify the collection being iterated

5. **Add conditional logic** (from Question 5: Conditions)
   - Insert "if/then" where branches exist
   - Make conditions explicit

6. **Identify intermediate concepts** (from Question 6: Intermediates)
   - Name each intermediate result
   - Show data flow between steps

7. **Add error handling** (from Question 7: Errors)
   - Add validation steps if needed
   - Specify fallback behavior

    {"question_number": 2, "answer": "User's message (text) and chat history"},
